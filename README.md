WLED cube v1 is a cube-shaped lamp, based on WLED software, developed for product presentation of ANO "School 21".\
Features:
- Based on ESP32 microcontroller
- Two ways of power supply the circuit: 24-5 volt DC or 2x 18650 batteries. 5 watt max power usage.
- Short circuit, overdischarge (NOT WORKING), reverse polarity (with indication) protections.
- Controlled by Telegram Bot via MQTT or through standart WLED web interface.
- 3-4 hours awake time with LiFePO4 batteries.

### Usage script
We had to make 120 lamps controlled remotely during the product presentation. There is a script: person, who is sitting on a cube, take a quiz. Cube reacts on person's answers. When the quiz isn't going on, all cubes must be controlled be moderator via Telegram Bot. All software, except WLED, was created by Sofia "Elf" Condrashova [GIT]
